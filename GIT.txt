GIT 
- It is a version control system (VCS)
- Allows multiple people to work on the code, so multiple contribution, different people can work on the same code and push the results later 
- Safe storage of code in case of hardware crash / system failure 
- manage and maintain different versions of the same piece of software ( branching) 
- Version tracking , you can revert to previous versions of the code 
- git is by far the best vcs
