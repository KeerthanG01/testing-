GIT 
- It is a version control system (VCS)
- Allows multiple people to work on the code, so multiple contribution, different people can work on the same code and push the results later 
- Safe storage of code in case of hardware crash / system failure 
- manage and maintain different versions of the same piece of software ( branching) 
- Version tracking , you can revert to previous versions of the code 
- git is by far the best vcs


-Understand the difference between pull request and push request 

- git clone - used to create a local copy of the code by downloading the repo from cloud to the machine 

- git status - gives you details of any new changes made or files added 

- git log - gives you the history of all the commits, who and when the commit was done . 

If you want to add the changes to the git cloud first thing you need to do is:

	- git add "filename" : bring the changes to the staging area 
	- git commit -m "Message" : commit to the changes,write the message indicating what chagnes have you made
	- git push : after commit push the changes made to the local copy to the cloud git repo

What if you want to revert the changes in your code ? 
	- you can revert back to the changes as follows:
		- git log : gives you history of previous commits 
		- take any commit ID
		- do git revert -n commitID and then push
